# Mavic Spoke Tool
Tool to fit the splined spoke nipple on a Mavic Crossmax ST mountain bike wheel. Might fit other Mavic wheels too, and can probably be customized using OpenSCAD to fit different size spoke nipples (maybe on some Mavic roadbike wheels).

# OpenSCAD
The 3D model (.scad) file is meant for OpenSCAD.  See: http://www.openscad.org/

# Why
The spoke wrench I got in the packet with my wheel set was the wrong size (guessing one of the repair shop guys at the store decided he needed it more than me and swapped it - but I didn't need it right away, so it was way too late when I checked). Anyway, it was quicker, cheaper, and easier to design and 3D-print this than to find someone with a Park SW-13, or to mail-order it and wait.

# 3D Print Notes
I printed it in ABS, which seems to work just fine. The spoke nipples are really easy to turn, so this thing will just save them from getting mangled by pliers.

# Update 2021-06-20
* Closer inspection of the spline reveailed that it has 7 teeth instead of 6 - model adjusted
* Some size tolerances updated to fit tighter
* hex flats added on the core part to accomodate a box end wrench or pliers for nipples that are stuck or tight.
* outer cut-ins changed to cube from cylinder to retain grip but (maybe) make it easier on hands.
